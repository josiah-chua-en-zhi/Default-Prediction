# Default-Prediction
This model is a stacked model of boosted trees and TabNets to predict if a person will default.

## Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

To analyse the data, the data was put into Facets a tool for ML data visualization and here are some of the key takeways that were used for feature enginenering and pre processing

### Skewed Data

The data provided is skewed as defaulting is less common, this could lead to overfitting when trianing the model causing the model to be bad at predicting the minority class. This is detrimental for a case of predicting default as it is more inportant to be able to detect defaulters than non defaulters as the cost to the company is greater. Hence to balnce the training dataset, sampling was used.

Oversampling was prefered and used instead of undersamoling due as it was able to increase the proportion of the minority class while retaining the information form the majority class.

SMOTE was used for oversampling. New minority class data are generated by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, and interpolating a new data point between those 2 points.

### Highly Non-Linear Numerical Data

#### Monthly Charges

As seen in the graphs for the different numerical features while tenure is slightly linear, the Mothly Charges and Total Charges are not and hence , simply using numerical data might affects the weights for that features as it contributes to the model differently at different ranges. Hence bucketing was done where new catergorical features were engineered based on different effects that different ranges have on the percetage of people who defaulted.

For skewed data, accuracy is not appropriate
